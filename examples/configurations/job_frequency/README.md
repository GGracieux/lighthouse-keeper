# Examples configurations - Job frequency

In order to test, cd into this directory and type "lightkeeper"

- As there is no lightkeeper.json file in this folder, lightkeeper will use its default configuration.
- The jobs.json file requires at least 3 properties per job (url, profiles and frequency) but you can add as many custom property to your job.
- This configuration adds a "description" property wich describes job frequency.
