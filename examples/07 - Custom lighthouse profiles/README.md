# Examples configurations - Lighthouse profiles

In order to test, cd into this directory and type "lightkeeper"

- As there is no lightkeeper.json file in this folder, lightkeeper will use its default configuration.
- The profile.mobile-desktopVersion.json file defines a lighthouse profile very similar to mobile profile (same CPU and network throttling) but with an "emulatedFormFactor" set to "desktop". It will mimic the performance of a mobile phone accessing desktop version of a website.
